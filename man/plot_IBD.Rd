\title{Plot marginal IBD matrix}
\usage{
plot_IBD(x, trueIBD = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{polyIBD}, as produced by the function
\code{polyIBD::runMCMC}}

\item{trueIBD}{option to overlay a line corresponding to the true IBD
(for example if using simulated data)}
}
\description{
Plots the full posterior IBD matrix between two samples. SNPs
are arranged in order on the x-axis, and the IBD level is given on the y-axis. This represents the number of genotypes that are shared between samples, with the lowest level (IBD=0) representing zero shared genotypes and hence no IBD. The intensity of colour represents the probability of each IBD level at each locus.
