\title{Simulate IBD sections between two samples}
\usage{
simIBD(f, k, rho, pos)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{the average relatedness between the two samples}

\item{k}{the number of generations separating the two lineages}

\item{rho}{the recombination rate. TODO - units of this parameter}

\item{pos}{the genomic positions of the sites of interest}
}
\description{
Walks along a vector of genomic locations and swiches between two states that represent IBD and non-IBD using a Markov model. The parameters that dictate the chance of switching state at any point include the average level of relatedness (\code{f}), the physical distance between loci in units of base pairs (from \code{pos}), and the recombination rate (\code{rho}), which is assumed constant over all loci.
