## Status
This is the branch that was presented at the Genomic Epidemiology of Malaria (GEM) Conference on June 13, 2018. We have now branched to `devo` to work on the within relatedness (F<sub>ws</sub>) parameter and the other updates discussed at GEM.  
  
For the time being, the `master` branch will be stable but is considered an alpha-version of the software. 

## Purpose 
  
R package for inferring blocks of identity by descent (IBD) from un-phased haplotypic data.
  

## Installation 
To install the current version of _polyIBD_, first ensure that you have the R-package _devtools_:
``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then download and build _polyIBD_ from Github with: 
``` r
devtools::install_github("nickbrazeau/polyIBD", ref = "master")
```
